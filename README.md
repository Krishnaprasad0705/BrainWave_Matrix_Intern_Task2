# Social Media Sentiment Analysis with VADER (NLP Project)

This project performs sentiment analysis on synthetic social media posts using NLP techniques and the VADER sentiment analyzer. The goal is to understand public sentiment trends by analyzing social text and visualizing sentiment distribution.

## Dataset

I used the *Social Media Sentiments Analysis* dataset from Kaggle, which includes synthetic posts from platforms like Reddit and Twitter.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- *Python* 3.11+
- *Pandas* for data handling
- *NLTK* for stopwords and VADER sentiment scoring
- *Seaborn & Matplotlib* for visualizations
- *RegEx* for text preprocessing
- *Google Colab* for cloud execution

---

## Data Preprocessing

1. Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags
2. Lowercased all text
3. Removed punctuation and stopwords using NLTK
4. Applied VADER sentiment analysis to generate a compound score

---

## Sentiment Classification Logic

- *Positive* if compound > 0.05
- *Negative* if compound < -0.05
- *Neutral* otherwise

---

## Visualizations

- *Pie Chart*: Proportion of predicted sentiment
- *Bar Chart*: Count of each sentiment class

---

## How to Run

1. Open Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb in *Google Colab*
2. Upload Train.csv and Test.csv via the Colab file uploader
3. Run all cells to clean, analyze, visualize, and export sentiment predictions
